This directory contains a few examples of how the Incr\_dom library
can be used.

** The examples, explained
   
(Examples with asterisks in front of their name link to in-depth
guides. The rest are stubs.)

- *[[./text_input/README.md][~Text_input~]]: Start here. This example unpacks a basic ~Incr_dom~
  application, explaining how all the various parts hang
  together. (The app implements a model-driven text input.) 
- ~Incr_decr~: The simplest example, which you should be able to
  understand after reading through the ~Text_input~ guide. Makes use of
  [[https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/incr_dom/Incr_dom/Incr/Map/#val-mapi'][Incr.Map.mapi']].
- [[./entry_table/README.md][~Entry_table~]]: A curses-like application that lets you move with the
  keyboard through rows of fake data that are constantly ticking with
  new information.
- ~Event_propagation~: An app that demonstrates DOM event propagation.
- [[./monitor/README.org][~Monitor~]]: Showcases error handling in ~incr_dom~.
- [[./partial_rendering_table/README.org][~Partial_rendering_table~]]: Uses the ~Partial_render_list~ module
  that's a part of ~Incr_dom_widgets~ to partially render a long
  vertical list.
- *[[./ts_gui/README.md][~Ts_gui~]]: A mockup of a very simple trading-system GUI.

** Build instructions: Running the examples

To run any of these examples, follow the steps below:

- =opam install incr_dom=

- =jbuilder build example/incr_decr/{main.bc.js,index.html}=

- Open =_build/default/example/incr_decr/index.html= in a web browser!
