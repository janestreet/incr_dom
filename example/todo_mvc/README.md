This is an implementation of the TODO MVC app using Incr\_dom.
In order to get it set up the following things were done:

1. Clone the app template repo (https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template.git)
2. Run `npm install` to populate the node\_modules directory
3. Compile using the info in `../REAMD.md` in the app/js directory
4. Run an http server or start a browser pointed at the app/ directory (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
